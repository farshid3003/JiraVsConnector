The Atlassian Connector for Microsoft Visual Studio is an Visual Studio package that lets you work<br>
with the Atlassian products within your IDE. Now you don't have to switch between websites,<br>
email messages and news feeds to see what's happening to your project and your code.<br>
Instead, you can see the relevant <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/">JIRA</a> issues
and <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/">Bamboo</a>
